3. Click "Import Project"
4. Select your repository
5. **Important**: Set these environment variables:
   - `NODE_ENV` = `production`
6. Click "Deploy"

### Step 3: Update CORS
After deployment, update `server.js` line 25 with your actual domain:
```javascript
origin: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
    ? ['https://your-actual-domain.vercel.app']
    : ['http://localhost:3000'],
```

‚úÖ **Your site will be live at**: `https://your-repo-name.vercel.app`

## üîß Post-Deployment Setup

### Update CORS Settings
After deploying, update the CORS configuration in `server.js`:

```javascript
app.use(cors({
    origin: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' 
        ? [
            'https://your-actual-domain.vercel.app',
            'https://your-actual-domain.netlify.app', 
            'https://your-actual-domain.railway.app',
            'https://your-actual-domain.onrender.com'
          ]
        : ['http://localhost:3000', 'http://127.0.0.1:3000'],
    credentials: true
}));
```

### Environment Variables
Set these on your hosting platform:
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- `PORT` = `3000` (or let platform auto-assign)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CORS Errors**
- Update the `origin` array in `server.js` with your actual domain
- Make sure `credentials: true` is set

**Build Failures**
- Check Node.js version (needs 18+)
- Run `npm install` locally to verify dependencies
- Check build logs on your platform

**WebSocket Issues**
- Some platforms have WebSocket limitations
- Check platform documentation for WebSocket support

**Function Timeout**
- Increase timeout in platform settings
- For Vercel: Already set to 30s in `vercel.json`

### Platform-Specific Issues

**Vercel**
- Functions have 10s timeout on free tier (30s configured)
- Check function logs in Vercel dashboard

**Railway**
- Check service logs in Railway dashboard
- Ensure health check endpoint is working

**Netlify**
- Functions have 10s timeout on free tier
- Background functions need Pro plan

**Render**
- Free tier spins down after inactivity
- Check service logs in Render dashboard

## üìä Performance Tips

### Optimize for Production
1. **Enable compression** (platforms usually handle this)
2. **Use environment variables** for configuration
3. **Monitor usage** with platform analytics
4. **Set up monitoring** with health checks

### Scaling Considerations
- Most platforms auto-scale
- Monitor connection limits
- Consider upgrading plans for heavy usage

## üîí Security Notes

1. **CORS Configuration**: Always restrict origins in production
2. **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting for public deployment
3. **Environment Variables**: Never commit secrets to git
4. **HTTPS**: All platforms provide HTTPS by default
